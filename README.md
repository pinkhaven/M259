# M259 | Machine-Learning

This is a small Machine-Learning Project in Python. 

To train a Modell, I'm using the Abalone dataset, from the UC Irvine Mach:ine Learning
[Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone)

Normally the age of an abalone is determined by cutting the shell though the cone, staining it, and counting the numbers of rings though a microscope. Other measurments, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.
