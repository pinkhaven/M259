    "After a little research on the sklearn algorithms, I realised that the \"Random Forest Regressor\" is the best fit for this Case.\\\n",
    "Random Forest is excellent for both classification and regression tasks, copes well with numerical and also categorical variables, and can handle irrelevant inputs.\\\n",
    "This is why it is one of the most widely used algorithms and also why I'm using it."
